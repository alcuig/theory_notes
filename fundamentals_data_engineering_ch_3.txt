DATA WAREHOUSE 
- central data hub used for reporting and analysis 
- typically highly formatted and structured for analytics use cases 

DATA MART 
- more refined subset of a warehouse designed to serve analytics and reporting
- focused on a single suburbanisation, department, or line of business 
- specific to the department's needs
- makes data more easily accessible to analysts and report developers
- additional stage of transformation beyond that provided by initial ETL or ELT pipelines which can improve performance of analytics queries with complex joins 

DATA LAKE
- dumps all data, structured and unstructured, into a central location
