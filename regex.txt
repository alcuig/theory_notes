Metacharacters

Here is a quick cheat sheet for metacharacters to help define the pattern:

METACHARACTER	DESCRIPTION					EXAMPLE	EXAMPLES MATCHES
^		Start the match at the beginning of a string	^c%	cat, car, chain
|		Alternation (either of two alternatives)	c(a|o)%	can, corn, cop
()		Group items in a single logical item		c(a|o)%	can, corn, cop
_		Any single character(using LIKE and SIMILAR TO) c_	co, fico, pico
%		Any string (using LIKE and SIMILAR TO)		c%	chart, articulation, crate
.		Any single character (using POSIX)		c.	co, fico, pico
.*		Any string (using POSIX)			c.*	chart, articulation, crate
+		Repetition of the previous item 1+ times	co+	coo, cool


Examples of Regex in SQL Queries

~		Match, case sensitive
~*		Match, not case sensitive

--> If you wanted to search a column of a database for all entries that contain the word ‘fire’, you could use ~* ‘fire’  to find any row that contains the word:

SELECT (column name)
FROM (table name)
WHERE (column name) ~* 'fire';


--> To get all entries that start with the word ‘Fire’:

SELECT (column name)
FROM (table name)
WHERE (column name) ~ * '^fire';
