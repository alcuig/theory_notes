1. DATA SCIENCE MATH FUNDAMENTALS

Brief maths refresher to the concepts needed to better understand the Mathematics theory behind Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

2. INTRO TO STATISTICS AND PROBABILITY - HISTOGRAMS
	- Stack data points together. 
	- Gives us a sense of how likely it is (probable) that we'll get certain measurements, and how they are distributed.
	- Can be used to predict the probability of getting future datapoints. 
	- Thicker part of histogram = shows the region where measurements are most likely. 
	- Whereas edges on extremities are rarer and less likely to happen in the future.
	- Used as distribution to approximate data (or future measurements).
	- Distribution =  function that shows how the probabilities of measurements are distributed.
	- I.e histograms and curves.

3. STATISTICS FUNDAMENTALS - PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS
	- We can use a curve to approximate a histogram.
	-  The curve has some advantages over the histogram.
	- Can be used to approximate probability in spite of no/little underlying data.
	- Calculated based on mean and standard deviation of collected data.

4. STATISTICS FUNDAMENTALS -  THE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION 
	- What is it and how do we interpret it?
	- aka "GAUSSIAN" distribution
	- or "BELL SHAPED CURVE"

	- the Y axis represents the relative probability of a measurement (on X axis) occurring 
	- from top MOST LIKELY to bottom LEAST LIKELY 

	- normal distributions are always centred on the average value
	- the width of the curve is defined by the standard deviation 
	- small standard deviation = tall and narrow
	- large standard deviation = short and spread out

	- normal curves are drawn such that 95% of the measurements fall between +/- 2 SD around the mean
	- ex if SD is 0.6, 95% measurements fall between mean +/- 1.2  
	- ex if SD is 4, 95% measurements fall between between mean +/- 8

	- To draw a normal distribution, you need to know:
		1. The average measurement.It tells you where the centre of the curve goes.
		2. The SD of the measurements, which tells you how wide the curve should be around the mean. 
		   The width of the curve determines how tall it is. The wider the curve, the shorter. 
		   The narrower the curve, the taller.

	- Central Limit Theorem 

5. STATISTICS FUNDAMENTALS -  POPULATION PARAMETERS
	- Population = set of data (which can be represented as a curve, histogram)
	- Mean and SD are population parameters 
	- Mean is called population mean, SD = Population SD

	- EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION 
	- its shape is determined by the Rate 
	- Shape and Rate are population parameters for Gamma distributions
